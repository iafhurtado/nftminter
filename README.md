# nftminter

This repo is a forked version of Scaffold-Eth-2 which is a Nextjs app using Typescript that interacts with smart contracts, connecting to multiple wallets (Rainbow Kit) and several providers (Wagmi).
You can mint an example NFT in Sepolia testnet, feel free to fork it and use it for any purposes you might need.
